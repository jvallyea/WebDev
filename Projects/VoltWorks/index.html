    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <div class="w3-justify">
      <p>If interested, please read our paper <a href="MFCPaper.pdf">here</a>. We researched techniques to optimize our fuel cell output from September 2014 to June 2015. For the next year, we sought to apply our research (in true engineering fashion) to see the fruits of our research; we hoped to one day pursue our technology to develop a fuel cell engineering firm. </p>
      <p>The principal mechanism behind a microbial fuel cell rests in the respiratory property of prokaryotic microbes. The prokaryotic analogue of an electron transport chain (ETC) involves shuttling of electrons along the outer cell membrane. These moving electrons constitute current, and if aggregated, can be used to drive electrical output. We sought to use electron carriers like methylene blue to shuttle electrons from a microbe-rich anode to a load, and ultimately to a reducing cathode. Special consideration was paid to ensure that the process was thermodynamically favorable, easily replicable, and environmentally conscious.
      <p> We constructed two fuel cells: one using an anoxic benthic soil-based environment, and the other using yeast. Benthic soil proved to be rich in a variety of prokaryotic microbes, lending stability to fuel cell output, while also being rich in inorganic compounds such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. We constructed a two-chambered fuel cell, filling one chamber with our benthic mud sample, and the other with water with a high dissolved-oxygen level. A proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) connected the two chambers, maintaining ion balance across the fuel cell. A similar setup was observed for the yeast fuel cell, except yeast and D-sucrose were added to the anodic chamber. </p>
      <p> Once we developed a design that yielded a stable output, we began testing our fuel cell in nature - along Wolftrap Creek (Vienna, VA). We saw the potential of our fuel cell to not only provide a clean source of energy, but also provide a mechanism through which water could be purified; when the electrons reach the cathode, they combine with hydrogen ions and dissolved oxygen to form water. We embedded the anode chamber along the banks of the river, completely immersing it in a benthic mud sample, while immersing the cathode chamber in flowing water. Since we tested during winter, dissolved oxygen concentrations were elevated (the flowing water provided another method for high levels of aeration). In the future, we hope to continue testing our fuel cells, and implement them as a means of managing industrial waste in an energy-efficient manner, while generating energy from the carbon-rich environment. </p>
